      <h2> Our Story </h2>
      <p> We started our business in 2010. Always resided in Cary, NC. A family from whom some of our members were affected by the fast-paced and fast food culture we live in with diminishing health due to what we discovered to be lack of appropriate and fresh eating with a combination of all work and no play. Our owner father of 4 sons and daughters, decided to do something about it. After multiple efforts of research, they began implementing customized disciplinary methods of eating and exercising on a daily basis. Each member of our family supported each other with encouragement and customized organic diets and exercising. 2 years later, the owner reversed his heart and high blood pressure condition to 100% healthy! And of the sons and daughters, who suffered from gluten intolerant problems, obtained full recovery and continue a gluten free and organic diet in combination with exercise targeted to build longevity.
        From there evolved our business Peak Training. </p>
